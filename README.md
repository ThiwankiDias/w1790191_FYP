# Final Year Research Project

### Defects Detection of vehicle Tyres by using YOLO algorithm

This is a cutting-edge research project, developed to classify and locate the defects in road transportation vehicle tyres and assess their risk levels using a deep learning algorithm. As the final outcome, user friendly mobile application is developed to serve as the client interface for end-users.
